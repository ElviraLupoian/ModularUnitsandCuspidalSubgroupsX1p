This is the code accompanying the arxiv pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04084

The files: Structure1.m, Structure2.m Structure3.m verify that certain subgroups are generated by the claimed divisors 
The file: CuspidalGroupX1p.m computes the cuspidal group and its rational subgroup 
The files: CuspidalGroupC1p.txt and RationalCuspidalGroupC1pQ.txt contain our computations of the cuspidal group and its rational subgroups for all 10 < p < 1000
